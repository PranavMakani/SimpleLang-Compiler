# SimpleLang Compiler

## Project Overview

The **SimpleLang Compiler** is a project that compiles code written in the SimpleLang programming language into assembly code for an 8-bit CPU. This project provides a clear understanding of the three core stages of compilation: lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

## Components

### 1. Lexer (`lexer.c`)

The Lexer (or lexical analyzer) is responsible for reading the source code character by character and converting it into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are the building blocks of the language, such as keywords, operators, and identifiers.

#### Key Functions:
- **`getNextToken(FILE* file, Token* token)`**: This function reads characters from the input file, identifies token patterns, and assigns the appropriate token type (e.g., `TOKEN_INT`, `TOKEN_IDENTIFIER`). It handles operators, punctuation, and whitespace, and it returns tokens like `TOKEN_ASSIGN` for `=` and `TOKEN_COMPARE` for `==`.

### 2. Parser (`parser.c`)

The Parser is responsible for analyzing the sequence of tokens produced by the Lexer and constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST represents the hierarchical structure of the source code.

#### Key Functions:
- **`Tree_junc* Execution(FILE* file, Token* Available_Token)`**: This function initiates parsing by consuming tokens and constructing the AST. It handles parsing for various statements, such as variable declarations and control flow (e.g., `if` statements).


### 3. Code Generator (`codegen.c`)

The Code Generator traverses the AST created by the Parser and generates the corresponding assembly code. This is the final step, where the high-level SimpleLang code is transformed into low-level instructions for the 8-bit CPU.

#### Key Functions:
- **`void assemblycode(Tree_junc* junc, FILE* file)`**: This recursive function generates assembly code by traversing the AST nodes. Depending on the type of AST node (e.g., an assignment, arithmetic operation, or conditional), it outputs the appropriate assembly instructions.

### 4. Main Program (`main.c`)

The Main Program is the entry point of the compiler. It ties together the Lexer, Parser, and Code Generator, orchestrating the entire compilation process from reading the input file to producing the assembly code.

#### Key Functions:
- **`int main()`**: The `main()` function initializes the compilation process by opening the input file, calling the Lexer to tokenize the code, invoking the Parser to build the AST, and finally, generating the assembly code using the Code Generator.


## How to Get Started

### Set Up the Simulator
First, you'll need to set up an 8-bit CPU simulator on your computer. This will allow you to run the assembly code generated by the compiler.

### Compile and Run
After setting up the simulator:
1. Compile the SimpleLang compiler using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiler with a SimpleLang source file as input.
3. The output will be assembly code, which can then run on simulator.
